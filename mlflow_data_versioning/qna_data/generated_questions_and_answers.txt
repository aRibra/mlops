     Question 2: What is the connection between recurrence and attention, according to the authors?
Answer 2: The authors theoretically derive the connection between recurrence and attention, showing that recurrence can be viewed as a form of attention.

     Question 3: What is the retention mechanism proposed in the work, and what are its three computation paradigms?
Answer 3: The retention mechanism is a sequence modeling approach that supports three computation paradigms: parallel, recurrent, and chunkwise recurrent. These paradigms allow for training parallelism, low-cost inference, and effiient sequence modeling, respectively.
